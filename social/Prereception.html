      <h2>ICSME Pre-reception</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Tuesday, September 25th from 17:45 to 21:30 at IMDEA Software Institute</h3>

      <p style="font-size:16px; text-indent:2em; text-align:justify;" class="alert alert-info"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Meeting point:</b> 17:45 at the entrance of the C&iacute;rculo de Bellas Artes (Calle del Marqu&eacute;s de Casa Riera, 2, 28014 Madrid). Please, be sure to be some minutes before at the meeting point, as we will leave at that time to the bus.</p>

      <p style="font-size:16px; text-indent:2em; text-align:justify;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; All ICSME, SCAM, VISSOFT and DysDoc participants are invited (at not cost) to the pre-reception on Tuesday evening. Buses will depart from the city center at <b>17:45</b>, meeting at the entrance of the C&iacute;culo de Bellas Artes. The pre-reception will start at 18:15 and finish around 21:30, and <b>food and drinks will be served</b> in an informal atmosphere where there will be <b>tool demos and poster presentations</b>.</p>

      <p style="font-size:16px; text-indent:2em; text-align:justify;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Authors of doctoral symposium, NIER, tool demo and short industry papers can present a poster on Tuesday evening in the pre-reception, in addition to their presentation at the main conference.</p>
      
      <p style="font-size:16px; text-indent:2em; text-align:justify;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; The pre-reception won't be in the main venue, but in the <b>IMDEA Software Institute</b> in the outskirts of Madrid (see map below). Although there is the possibility to <a href="http://software.imdea.org/contact_and_directions/directions.html">get there by public transportation</a>, it takes long (more than one hour). That is why a specific bus service to the IMDEA Software for the pre-reception will depart from the city center (the main venue, CÃ­rculo de Bellas Artes) at 17:45 (strict!). And there will be buses back to the city center starting at 21:00.</p>
     
      <p style="font-size:16px; text-indent:2em; text-align:justify;">&nbsp; The main focus of the IMDEA Software Institute (the Madrid Institute for Advanced Studies in Software Development Technologies) is to perform the research of excellence required to devise methods that will allow the cost-effective development of software products with sophisticated functionality and high quality, i.e., safe, reliable, and efficient. In order to achieve this goal the Institute is gathering a critical mass of world-wide, top class researchers and providing them with an ideal research environment.</p>
