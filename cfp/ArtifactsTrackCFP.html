          <h2>Artifacts Track - Call for Papers</h2>
          <hr>
          <h3>Goal and Scope</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp The ICSME 2018 artifacts track exists to promote, celebrate, and catalog excellent examples of research artifacts in software engineering. These artifacts are reusable units of research that can be used to support other research endeavors.</p>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Artifacts of interest include (but are not limited to) the following: </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Software, which are implementations of systems or algorithms potentially useful in other studies. </li>
            <li>Data repositories, which are data (e.g., logging data, system traces, survey raw data, etc.) that can be used for multiple software engineering approaches.</li>
            <li>One additional proceedings page for the associated paper, to be used to describe the artifact</li>
            <li>Frameworks, which are tools and services illustrating new approaches to software engineering that could be used by other researchers in different contexts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp This list is not exhaustive, but if your proposed artifact is not on this list, please email the chairs before submitting. For artifacts that are executable tools, you may also consider submitting to the <a href="https://icsme2018.github.io/cfp/ToolDemoTrackCFP.html">ICSME 2018 tool demonstrations track</a>. </p>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp ICSME 2018 allows two types of artifact submissions:</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp <b>Evaluation artifacts:</b> For artifacts related to a research track paper accepted at ICSME 2018. Authors of accepted artifacts of this type will enjoy the following benefits:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Recognition on the conference website</li>
            <li>A one-page paper in the proceedings describing the artifact</li>
            <li>The opportunity to present the artifact in a dedicated artifacts session at the conference (in addition to the presentation for the associated research track paper)</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp <b>Independent artifacts:</b> For artifacts related to a paper published previously or unrelated to any paper published so far. Authors of accepted artifacts of this type will enjoy the following benefits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A one-page paper in the proceedings describing the artifact</li>
            <li>The opportunity to present the artifact in a dedicated artifacts session at the conference</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp  Both types of submissions have the same submission instructions and packaging guidelines and will be evaluated by the same PC using the same evaluation criteria. </p>

          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp All submissions that meet the submission criteria (see below), fit the scope of the conference, and comply with the IEEE plagiarism policy and procedures will be reviewed by three members of the artifacts track program committee. Submissions will be evaluated as accepted or rejected.</p>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Artifacts will be scored using the following scorecard:</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp <b>Insightful</b></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Timely (i.e., addresses a problem that is most current and most pressing)?</li>
            <li>Makes researchers "smarter" in some way (e.g., identifies and fills some significant gap in prior work)?</li>
          </ol>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp <b>Useful</b></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Serves a useful purpose?</li>
            <li>Serves a purpose that would otherwise be tedious, prolonged, awkward, or impossible?</li>
            <li>Cost-effective?</li>
          </ol>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp <b>Usable</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Easy to understand?</li>
            <li>Accompanied by tutorial notes?</li>
            <li>Artifacts need not be executable but if so, are they:
              <ul>
                <li>Easy to download, install, or execute?</li>
                <li>Available in a virtual machine image?</li>
                <li>Available online?</li>
                <li>Supported by configuration management tools to permit easy updates?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Submission</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Submissions should be made by the deadline via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsme2018">EasyChair</a>. Submissions should follow the conference format, be limited to a single page, and contain:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Names, affiliations, and email addresses for the authors.</li>
            <li>A description of the artifact.</li>
            <li>A URL to download the artifact. This could also be a URL to a GitHub repository.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp To hide the identity of the reviewers from the authors, the artifact track chairs will download the artifact and distribute it to the reviewers. The authors should also make an effort not to learn the identity of the reviewers, e.g., through logging.</p>

          <h3>Artifact Packaging Guidelines</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp High-quality packaging of an artifact is as important as the quality of the artifact itself. Please keep in mind that the committee members will have limited time to review each artifact. The following requirements for the artifact are meant to expedite the review process:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Create a single zip archive</b>, containing a <b>README text file</b> with instructions (how to use the artifact, how to reproduce the results presented in the ICSME'18 research paper, if the artifact is associated to one), <b>the ICSME'18 research paper</b> (if applicable), and <b>the artifact itself</b>. Additionally, you may submit a video with a demo and/or instructions.</li>
            <li>In case you want to submit a running setup of your artifact, please provide an installation script to simplify the reviewing process. If the artifact requires a non-standard environment (e.g., specific OS, many external dependencies) we encourage you to create a virtual machine using Virtual box (<a href="www.virtualbox.org">www.virtualbox.org</a>).Please use only such system images that are compatible with Virtual box.</li>
            <li>If obtaining all the results takes a significant amount of time, please also include a script to reproduce only a subset of the results.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Important Dates</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Paper submission: Monday, June 18th, 2018  at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12)</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Author notification: Friday, July 6th, 2018</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Camera ready: Sunday, July 15th, 2018</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Early Bird Registration: Sunday, July 15th, 2018</p>
