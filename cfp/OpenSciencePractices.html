          <h2>Open Science Practices</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&nbsp &nbsp These guidelines are adapted from the Open Science Practices of the <a href="http://www.chaseresearch.org/workshops">CHASE Workshop series</a>.</i></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp We encourage authors to use open science practices to make their research and data accessible to anybody in the world. Here are guidelines and recommendations for open access, open data, and open source.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp The following guidelines <u>are recommendations and not mandatory</u>. Your choice to use open science will not affect the review process for your paper.</p>
          <h3>Open Access</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp We encourage authors to self-archive their pre- and post-prints in open, preserved repositories. This is legal and allowed by all major publishers including <a href="https://rchive.it/#association+for+computing+machinery-21">ACM</a> and <a href="https://rchive.it/#institute+of+electrical+and+electronics+engineers">IEEE</a> (granted in the copyright transfer agreement), and it lets anybody in the world reach your paper.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp If the authors of your paper wish to do this, we recommend:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Upon acceptance, revise your article according to the peers' comments, generate a PDF version, and submit your paper to <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> and choose the <a href="https://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/license.html">arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license to distribute</a>. </li>
          </ul>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Note that you are not allowed to self-archive the PDF of the published article, that is, the PDF that you can find in IEEE Xplore. Only self-archive your own generated PDFs. </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp We encourage you to use a preserved, archived repository instead of your personal website. Personal websites are prone to changes and errors, and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.10018/abstract;jsessionid=27835D49DD25800DCA61C74307CDD0C9.f04t01">more than 30% of them will not work in a 4 years period</a>.</p>
          <h3>Open Data and Open Source</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp We encourage authors of accepted papers to make their data public, in order to enhance the transparency of the process and the reproducibility of the results.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp If the authors of your paper wish to do this, we recommend:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Archive their data on preserved archives such as <a href="https://zenodo.org/">zenodo.org</a> and <a href="https://figshare.com/">figshare.com</a>, so that the data will receive a DOI and become citable.</li>
            <li>Use the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0">CC0 dedication</a> when publishing the data (automatic when using zenodo and figshare), as <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_use_for_data">explained on the Creative Commons site</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp We encourage authors to make their research software accessible as <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/">open source and citable</a>.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp We encourage you to avoid putting data and source on your own personal websites or services intended for generic file sharing, since <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002/asi.10018">more than 30% of them will not work in a 4 years period</a>.</p>

          <h2>Notes</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp <b>Note about GitHub research.</b> If your research includes scraped GitHub data, the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/">GitHub Terms of Service</a> require that "publications resulting from that research are open access". ICSME supports and encourages Green Open Access (see below).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp <b>Note about open access.</b> ICSME supports and encourages Green Open Access also called self-archiving (see Open Science Practices), that is, you as an author archive a version of the paper yourself at your personal home page, at an institutional repository of your employer, or at an e-print server such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> (preferred). Open access increases the availability of your work and <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013636">increases citation impact for higher quality research</a>. To learn more about open access, please read the <a href="https://avandeursen.com/2016/11/06/green-open-access-faq/">Green Open Access FAQ</a> by Arie van Deursen.
