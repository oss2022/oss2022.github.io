      <h2>Experience Reports - Call for Contributions</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Goal and Scope</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp OSS and OpenSym 2022 also invite authors to submit a short (two page) abstract containing the title and a description of the content of experience reports. Authors of accepted short abstracts for experience reports are invited to bring accepted talks to be presented during the conference.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp The OSS and OpenSym 2022 experience reports track highlights practical and real-world studies of OSS and Open Collaboration. Submissions to this track should address</p>
      <ul>
            <li>Real-world success and/or failure stories and evidences of open source software and open collaboration</li>
            <li>Experiences and lessons applying state-of- the-art methods, techniques and tools to practitioner problems in open source sofware and open collaboration</li>
            <li>New and unsolved challenges derived from practical problems</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp We are interested in results, obstacles, and lessons learned.</p>

      <h3>Submission Types</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp We invite submissions of state-of- the-art practice and experience reports, survey reports from
real-world projects and industrial experiences, and evidence-based identification of unsolved research challenges associated to OSS and Open Collaboration. Each submission should describe the problem addressed, the approach used, the current state of the project, an evaluation of the benefits or lessons learned, and future developments...</p>


      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp We welcome submission that are mainly driven by practitioners as much as submissions that
are mainly driven by researchers!</p>
	<ul>
            <li>Researcher-driven submissions: A paper is considered researcher-driven if the main author(s) are researchers (the paper can have industrial co-authors). Researcher-driven submissions to the industry track should be distinguished from research track submissions by richness in industrial/practitioner data or their focus on industrial/practitioner cases.
            <li> Practitioner-driven submissions: A paper is considered practitioner-driven if the main author(s) are practitioners (the paper can have co-authors from academia). These papers may focus more on specific cases or applications and do not require the same degree of generalizability as researcher-driven submissions.
	</ul>

      <h3>Reviews</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Submissions will be lightly reviewed to scope of the submissions. Submissions that are out of the scope of the conference will be rejected. Papers that successfully pass the review process will be accepted for presentation and publication in the companion volume.  Presentation details will follow notifications of acceptance.</p>

<!--
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp The below criteria will be considered by the reviewers:</p>
      <ul>
            <li><b>Relevance to OSS and OpenSym audience</b>
              <p style="text-align:justify;">The core concepts of the work either originate in research, either at OSS, OpenSym or a related conference, or are novel OSS and OpenSym-appropriate topics. </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Improvement on the state-of-the-practice or state-of-knowledge</b>
              <p style="text-align:justify;">The amount of improvement that the work achieves above and beyond the state-of- the-practice (demonstrated with evidence from practice) or the scale of the impact (e.g., individual vs team vs several teams) of the tech transfer work demonstrated with evidence from practice. </p>
            </li>
             <li><b>Generality of results (researcher-driven papers):</b>
              <p style="text-align:justify;">The probability that the work, approach, or lessons learned are applicable to developers outside of the studied group.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Clarity of lessons learned:</b>
              <p style="text-align:justify;">The clarity in which the lessons learned are presented and how well they are supported with data and discussion.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Overall quality of the manuscript</b>
            </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Publication and Presentation</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Accepted papers will not be part of the OSS and OpenSym conference proceedings, but of the companion volume.</p>
