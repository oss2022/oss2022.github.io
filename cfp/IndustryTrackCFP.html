      <h2>Industry Track - Call for Papers</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Goal and Scope</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp The industry track brings together participants from academia and industry in a venue that
highlights practical and real-world studies of software maintenance and evolution. This track aims to foster mutually-beneficial links between those engaged in scientific research and practitioners working to improve software maintenance and evolution practices. Experiences
from practitioners provide crucial input into future research directions and allow others to learn from successes and failures.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp The ICSME 2018 industry track highlights practical and real-world studies of software maintenance and evolution. Submissions to this track should address</p>
      <ul>
            <li>Real-world success and/or failure stories and evidences evolving and maintaining systems</li>
            <li>Experiences and lessons applying state-of- the-art methods, techniques and tools to industrial software evolution and maintenance problems</li>
            <li>New and unsolved challenges derived from practical problems</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp We are interested in results, obstacles, and lessons learned. If you apply in an industrial
context a method, technique, or tool that was previously presented at ICSME or another software engineering conference, we greatly encourage you to submit to this track. </p>

      <h3>Submission Types</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp We invite submissions of state-of- the-art practice and experience reports, survey reports from
real-world projects and industrial experiences, and evidence-based identification of unsolved research challenges associated to software maintenance and evolution. Each submission should describe the problem addressed, the approach used, the current state of the project, an evaluation of the benefits or lessons learned, and future developments. Submissions can be either short (4 pages) or long (10 pages).</p>
      <ul>
            <li>Short papers (4 pages) may include: 
            <ul><li>New and unsolved research challenges derived from practical problems</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Success stories reporting benefits and lessons learned</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Failure stories reporting obstacles and lessons learned</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Long papers (10 pages) may include: 
            <ul><li>State-of-the-practice and experience reports with empirical evidences</li></ul>
            <ul><li>State-of-the-practice surveys reports from real-world projects</li></ul>
            <ul><li>In-depth application reports about methods, techniques, and tools</li></ul>   
            </li>
      </ul>

      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp We welcome submission that are mainly driven by practitioners as much as submissions that
are mainly driven by researchers!</p>
	<ul>
            <li>Researcher-driven submissions: A paper is considered researcher-driven if the main author(s) are researchers (the paper can have industrial co-authors). Researcher-driven submissions to the industry track should be distinguished from research track submissions by richness in industrial data or their focus on industrial cases.
            <li> Practitioner-driven submissions: A paper is considered practitioner-driven if the main author(s) are practitioners (the paper can have co-authors from academia). These papers may focus more on specific cases or applications and do not require the same degree of generalizability as researcher-driven submissions.
	</ul>

      <h3>Reviews</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Submissions will be reviewed by at least two members of the industry track program committee. The committee consists to 50-70% of practitioners, who have a good understanding of the value of industry contributions. The evaluation serves the purpose to ensure the quality of the submissions
and provide constructive feedback. Papers that successfully pass the review process will be accepted for presentation and publication. The type of the paper (researcher-driven or practitioner-driven) will be considered during the review. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp The below criteria will be considered by the reviewers:</p>
      <ul>
            <li><b>Relevance to ICSME audience</b>
              <p style="text-align:justify;">The core concepts of the work either originate in research,either at ICSME or a related conference, or are novel ICSME-appropriate topics. </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Improvement on the state-of-the-practice or state-of-knowledge</b>
              <p style="text-align:justify;">The amount of improvement that the work achieves above and beyond the state-of- the-practice (demonstrated with evidence from practice) or the scale of the impact (e.g., individual vs team vs several teams) of the tech transfer work demonstrated with evidence from practice. </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Generality of results (researcher-driven papers):</b>
              <p style="text-align:justify;">The probability that the work, approach, or lessons learned are applicable to developers outside of the studied group.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Clarity of lessons learned:</b>
              <p style="text-align:justify;">The clarity in which the lessons learned are presented and how well they are supported with data and discussion.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Overall quality of the manuscript</b>
            </li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Submissions that are not in compliance with the required submission format or that are out of the scope of the conference will be rejected without being reviewed. Submitted papers must comply with IEEE plagiarism policy and procedures. Papers submitted to the industry track must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration for ICSME 2018. </p>

      <h3>Publication and Presentation</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Accepted papers will be published in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Please review the <a href="PubRequirements.html">ICSME 2018 Publication Requirements</a> for more details. Presentation details will follow notifications of acceptance. </p>

      <h3>How to Submit</h3>

Submitted papers must adhere to the following rules:. Submitted papers must adhere to the following rules: </p>

            <li>References to authors' own related work must be in the third person. (For example, not "We build on our previous work..."; but rather "We build on the work of...")</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Please see the <a href="DB_FAQ.html">Double-Blind Reviewing FAQ</a> for more information and guidance.</p>
