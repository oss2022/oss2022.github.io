      <h2>Tool Demo Track - Call for Papers</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Goal and Scope</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp The ICSME 2018 Tool Demonstration track represents a unique opportunity for practitioners and researchers alike to present and discuss novel software maintenance and evolution tools. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp We welcome submissions for tools ranging from research prototypes to industry-strength mature tools. We also encourage submissions that accompany papers from the Research Paper track. While research papers describe the foundation for a proposed approach, a tool demo paper describes the incarnation of the approach in a tool with a focus on the tool's architecture and implementation, the intended usage scenarios, and its evaluation with respect to these scenarios</p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Accepted papers will be published as part of the conference proceedings.</p>

      <h3>Review Criteria</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Each Tool Demo submission will be evaluated by at least three members of the program committee. The evaluation criteria include:</p>
      <ol>
            <li>Relevance of the proposed tool to the ICSME community </li>
            <li>Clear motivation behind the tool including typical usage scenarios</li>
            <li>The novelty of the proposed tool and/or its architecture</li>
            <li>Technical soundness of the tool</li>
            <li>Intrinsic/extrinsic evaluation of the tool</li>
            <li>Consideration of the relevant literature</li>
            <li>Presentation quality and originality of the paper and its accompanying video</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Submission</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Submissions for the Tool Demo track must satisfy the following criteria: </p>

      <ol>
            <li>Describe a tool, according to the above guidelines, that is within scope of the conference's software maintenance and evolution topics. Please refer to the <a href="https://icsme2018.github.io/cfp/ResearchTrackCFP.html">CFP</a> of the conference's Research Track for examples.
 </li>
            <li>Adhere to the <a href="https://icsme2018.github.io/cfp/formatting-instructions.html">ICSME 2018 formatting instructions.</a>
</li>
            <li>Be submitted as PDF to the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsme2018">Tool Demo track via Easy Chair</a>.</li>
            <li>Not exceed 5 pages: <b>4 pages for the content + 1 page for references only.</b></li>
            <li>Be accompanied by a link to a <b>3-to-5 minutes video</b> that shows a typical usage scenario of the tool. The video can be made available via YouTube or on the tool's website.</li>
            <li>Need not be blinded (i.e., authors will remain visible to the reviewers). This to facilitate reporting on characteristics such as the tool's ecosystem, community support, etc.</li>

      </ol>

      <h3>Presentation</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Authors of accepted papers will be invited to give a presentation at the conference. At least one author should be present. The presentation should include either a live or a recorded tool demonstration.
 </p>

      <h3>Important Dates</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp (Submissions close at 23:59 AoE) </p>
