          <h2>Publication Requirements for ICSME 2018 </h2>
          <hr>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. All authors of all accepted papers will be asked to complete an electronic IEEE Copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing their camera-ready versions. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper at the conference. Failure of at least one author to register by the early registration date will result in the paper being withdrawn from the conference proceedings. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., by not placing it in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library) if the paper is not presented at the conference.</p>

          <h4>Note about GitHub research. </h4>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp If your research includes scraped GitHub data, the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/"> GitHub Terms of Service </a> require that “publications resulting from that research are open access”. ICSME supports and encourages Green Open Access also called self-archiving (see Open Science Practices), that is, you as an author archive a version of the paper yourself at your personal home page, at an institutional repository of your employer, or at an e-print server such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/"> arXiv</a> (preferred). Open access increases the availability of your work and <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013636">increases citation impact for higher quality research </a>. To learn more about open access, please read the <a href="https://avandeursen.com/2016/11/06/green-open-access-faq/"> Green Open Access FAQ</a> by Arie van Deursen. If possible, we recommend that you archive your paper (e.g., on arXiv or on your website) only after the ICSME reviewing process is completed, to avoid undermining the double-blind reviewing process in place. </p>
