          <h2>NIER (New Ideas and Emerging Results) Track - Call for Papers</h2>
          <hr>
          <h3>Goal and Scope</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp  The goal of the New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) track is to provide researchers and practitioners with a forum for presenting great, promising ideas in early stages of research. These ideas do not require a strong empirical evaluation! The topics of interest for this track are the same as for the main research track, that is, all the topics in the research and practice of software maintenance and evolution. Papers submitted to ICSME NIER 2018 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration for ICSME NIER 2018.</p>
          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their originality, importance of contribution, soundness, quality and consistency of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Special emphasis will be put on the originality and timeliness of the proposed contribution, that is, a full evaluation of the proposed ideas is not required. Submissions will be reviewed by members of the ICSME NIER 2018 Program Committee.</p>
          <h3>Publication and Presentation</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Accepted papers will be published in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Please review the <a href="https://icsme2018.github.io/cfp/PubRequirements.html">ICSME 2018 Publication Requirements</a> for more details. Presentation details will follow notifications of acceptance. </p>
          <h3>How to Submit</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp For 2018 we will continue the lightweight double-blind reviewing process that was embraced in ICSME 2017 based on the success of double-blind reviewing in last year's ICSME. Submitted papers must adhere to the following rules: </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Author names and affiliations must be omitted. (The track co-chairs will check compliance before reviewing begins.)</li>
            <li>  References to authors' own related work must be in the third person. (For example, not "We build on our previous work..."; but rather "We build on the work of...")</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Please see the <a href="https://icsme2018.github.io/cfp/DB_FAQ.html">Double-Blind Reviewing FAQ</a> for more information and guidance.</p>

          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Submissions must be in English and conform to the <a href="https://icsme2018.github.io/cfp/formatting-instructions.html">ICSME 2018 Formatting Instructions</a>. Papers must not exceed five pages for all text, including references, appendices, figures, and tables. All submissions must be in PDF and must be submitted online via the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsme2018">ICSME 2018 EasyChair</a> conference management system.  All authors, reviewers, organizers are expected to uphold the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/about/ieee_code_of_conduct.pdf">IEEE Code of Conduct</a></p>
