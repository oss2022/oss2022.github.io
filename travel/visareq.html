            &nbsp &nbsp A visa is a travel document issued by authorized government agencies to foreign citizens applying to enter, exit from or transit through the host country's territory based on the host country's laws and regulations. In accordance with international law and practice, any sovereign state is entitled to decide on whether or not to allow a foreign citizen to enter or exit from its territory, and whether to issue a visa, decline a visa application or to cancel an issued visa in accordance with its national laws. Spanish consular officials are entitled to decide on the type, number of entries, validity and duration of each stay of a visa to be issued based on Spanish and European laws and regulations. Consular officials reserve the right to decline a visa application or revoke an issued visa.
          </p>
