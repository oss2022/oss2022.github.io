        <h2>Soccer (including tickets to matches)</h2>
        <hr>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Madrid is world-known for two of its professional football teams, <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com/en">Real Madrid</a> (14 times UEFA Champions Leage winner) and <a href="http://www.atleticodemadrid.com/">Atl&eacute;tico de Madrid</a>.</p>

        <ul>
          <li> Football fans won't want to miss a visit to the magnificent Santiago Bernab&eacute;u, home to the legendary Real Madrid football team. If so, you should do the <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com/en/tickets/tour-bernabeu">Bernab&eacute;u Tour</a> which takes around 60 minutes and costs from 12 to 15 &euro;.
          <li> Apart from visiting the Santiago Bernab&eacute;u Stadium, attendees can also visit the <a href="http://en.atleticodemadrid.com/noticias/take-a-tour-of-the-wanda-metropolitano">new Wanda Metropolitano Stadium</a> and see its facilities, inaugurated in September 2017. The Wanda Metropolitano hosted the final game of the UEFA European Champions League in May 2019.
        </ul>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp <b>Getting tickets</b> to watch Real Madrid matches is not easy (and certainly expensive). If you want to attend one match of the Spanish LaLiga at the Bernab&eacute;u, you should buy tickets well in advance, as tickets get sold-out fast. However, the definite date and time of the match is finally set just three weeks in advance, and could be on Saturday or on Sunday.</p>
<!--        
        
         During the week of OSS, following matches will take place in the Bernab&eacute;u stadion:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Real Madrid vs Espanyol</b> (22nd September 20:45). <a href="https://realmadrid.entradas.com/sports-web/Real_Madrid/Futbol/2018-2019/LALIGA_2018-2019/REAL_MADRID_CF_-_RCD_ESPANYOL/">Official tickets</a> can be bought directly around two weeks in advance (until then only expensive VIP tickets can be bought). <i>Madridistas</i> have priority when purchasing tickets. If you are not a <i>Madridista</i>, you <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com//en/fans/madridistas/discounts-benefits-promotions/priority-access-to-bernabeu-tickets">can become one and enjoy having ticket purchase priority</a> (i.e., tickets are available to <i>Madridistas</i> two days before than to the general public).</li>
          <li> <b>Real Madrid vs Atl&eacute;tico de Madrid</b> (29th September 20:45). <a href="https://realmadrid.entradas.com/sports-web/Real_Madrid/Futbol/2018-2019/LALIGA_2018-2019/REAL_MADRID_CF_-_C._AT._DE_MADRID/">Official tickets</a> can be bought around two weeks in advance (until then only expensive VIP tickets can be bought). <i>Madridistas</i> have priority when purchasing tickets. If you are not a <i>Madridista</i>, you <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com//en/fans/madridistas/discounts-benefits-promotions/priority-access-to-bernabeu-tickets">can become one and enjoy having ticket purchase priority</a> (i.e., tickets are available to <i>Madridistas</i> two days before than to the general public).</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Another option is to try to get tickets using the secondary marketplace <a href="https://www.onlineticketexpress.com/sports/football/real-madrid-tickets">onlineticketexpress.com</a> or the ticket resale site <a href="https://www.viagogo.com/Sports-Tickets/International-Soccer/More-Soccer/Spanish-Premier-League/Real-Madrid-FC-Tickets/">Viagogo</a> (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viagogo">Wikipedia page on Viagogo</a>).
